# routemaster_client

A Ruby API for the [Routemaster](https://github.com/HouseTrip/routemaster) event
bus.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'routemaster_client'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install routemaster_client

## Usage

**Configure** your client:

```ruby
require 'routemasterclient'
client = RoutemasterClient.new(url: 'https://bus.example.com', uuid: 'john-doe')
```


**Push** an event about an entity in the topic `widgets` with a callback URL:

```ruby
client.created('widgets', 'https://app.example.com/widgets/1')
client.updated('widgets', 'https://app.example.com/widgets/2')
client.noop('widgets', 'https://app.example.com/widgets/3')
```

There are methods for the four canonical event types: `created`, `updated`,
`deleted`, and `noop`.

`noop` is typically used when a subscriber is first connected (or reset), and
the publisher floods with `noop`s for all existing entities so subscribers can
refresh their view of the domain.


**Register** to be notified about `widgets` and `kitten` at most 60 seconds after
events, in batches of at most 500 events, to a given callback URL:

```ruby
client.subscribe(
  topics:   ['widgets', 'kitten'],
  callback: 'https://app.example.com/events',
  timeout:  60_000,
  max:      500)
```


**Monitor** the status of topics and subscriptions:

```ruby
client.monitor_topics
#=> [ { name: 'widgets', publisher: 'john-doe', events: 12589 }, ...]

client.monitor_subscriptions
#=> [ { 
#     subscriber: 'bob',
#     callback:   'https://app.example.com/events',
#     topics:     ['widgets', 'kitten'],
#     events:     { sent: 21_450, queued: 498, oldest: 59_603 }
#  } ... ]
```
